## Parking Lot (Deferred Ideas)

The following ideas require further investigation or are dependent on other initiatives:

1. **"ASOS Knows You" sizing** - Requires ML team capacity
2. **TikTok trending section** - Legal review needed for content licensing
3. **Wishlist public sharing** - Privacy impact assessment required
4. **Style Twin matching** - Dependent on recommendation engine upgrade

## Key Insights from Discussion

### What participants said:

> "The first 30 seconds are everything - if they don't see something relevant, they're gone."

> "We're trying to be everything to everyone. Personalization lets us be the right thing to each person."

> "Speed wins. If Shein loads faster, we lose regardless of our product quality."

> "Social proof is underused - real customers are more convincing than our marketing."

### Themes from retrospective:

- **Strong consensus:** First-session personalization is the biggest lever
- **Debate:** Discounts vs. value-add (some concern about margin impact)
- **Surprise insight:** Technical speed mentioned by non-engineers as friction
- **Risk identified:** Over-personalizing could feel "creepy"
